# Read Remote .json File and Output .pdf File (Go)
Just a reference for myself to refer back to when working on future GoLang projects. Reads in remote JSON file and outputs data in formatted PDF file.

# Setup
*To Run:*
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/golang-json2pdf
  cd golang-json2pdf
  go run main.go
  ```
*Formatted output.pdf file will generate in the project root*
